<h1>PSW Sound Monitoring System</h1>
<p>This system was featured in the Sound and Vibration article "Cost-Effective Wireless System for Large-Scale Noise Monitoring".
<div class="announcement"><p>We presented a paper on <a href="http://psw-tech.com/NoiseCon2011WirelessSoundMonitoring.doc" target = "_blank">"Automatic Wireless Sound Monitoring System and Its Application at Caldecott Tunnel"</a> at Noise-Con 2011.</div>
<p>One of the challenges of remote sound monitoring is real time data access. PSW-Tech has solved the challenge by using a 3G sound monitoring station that uploads real time sound data to an internet web site. The system is installed at 10 monitoring stations at Caldecott Tunnel in California.
<h2>Real Time Sound Data Website</h2>
<p><a class="right" href="http://www.mei-wu.com/pswdemo/station.htm?X"><img src="chart.png" alt="chart"></a>
Live data is transmitted wirelessly to a website where sound levels can be reviewed at any time. Time averaged sound (Leq) and maximum sound (Lmax) levels are graphed for easy review as well as a searchable history of sound data.

<h2>Instant Alarm and Audio Recordings</h2>
<p>The sound monitoring system provides instantaneous notification via text message (SMS) and/or e-mail to any mobile phone or computer when the sound level criteria are exceeded. It also provides audio recordings of exceedance events to identify the source of the event.
<h2>Wireless Data Transmission (3G/Wi-Fi)</h2>
<p><a class="left" href="photos.htm"><img src="pole.jpg" alt="photo"></a>
Sound data can be transmitted to the real time website via a 3G data connection or a Wi-Fi computer network. This allows the monitoring system to be completely wireless in remote locations where 3G/Wi-Fi signals are available.
<h2>Vibration Monitoring System</h2>
See <a href="product.htm">product page</a> for more details
<h2>Fully Customizable Set-ups</h2>
<p>Each sound monitoring system can independently send data to the website which allows for up to 30 sound monitors to be operating simultaneously. The sound monitor can also be adapted to be a vibration monitor for excavation/blasting projects.
