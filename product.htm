<h1>Product Information</h1>
<div class="announcement"><p>PSW-Tech presented a paper on <a href="http://psw-tech.com/NoiseCon2011WirelessSoundMonitoring.doc" target = "_blank">"Automatic Wireless Sound Monitoring System and Its Application at Caldecott Tunnel"</a> at Noise-Con 2011.</div>
<h2>PSW-CES160</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://datasheets.cesva.com/sc160_eng.pdf">CESVA SC-160 Sound Level Meter</a>.
<li>A-weighted Leq and Lmax published at the top of each hour. Independent noise criteria for weekdays and weekend days, and for each hour between 7 pm and 7 am.
<li>Instantaneous notification via text message (SMS) and/or e-mail to any mobile phone or computer when the sound level criteria are exceeded.
<li>Audio recordings of exceedance events to identify the sound source of the event.
<li>Up to 30 sound monitoring stations.
<li>Wireless data transmission (3G or Wi-Fi).
<li>All sound levels and exceedance audio recordings are archived automatically.
<li>This system has been operating since Jan. 2010 at 6 community monitoring stations and 4 construction site monitoring stations at <a href="http://www.caldecott-tunnel.org/">Caldecott Tunnel, CA</a>. Go to Construction &gt; Noise Data to see nighttime sound data at 6 community monitoring stations.
</ul>
<h2>PSW-NL21</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.m-r-c.co.il/Media/Uploads/NL-21_31OPR.pdf">Rion NL-21 Sound Level Meter</a>.
<li>A-weighted LEq and Lmax published at the top of each hour.
<li>Noise criteria for every hour throughout a day.
<li>Instantaneous notification via text message (SMS) and/or e-mail to any mobile phone or computer when the sound level criteria are exceeded.
<li>Audio recordings of exceedance events to identify the sound source of the event.
<li>Up to 30 sound monitoring stations.
<li>Wireless data transmission (3G or Wi-Fi).
<li>All sound levels and exceedance audio recordings are archived automatically.
<li><a href="http://mei-wu.com/pswdemo/">See a demo</a>. The system monitors A-weighted hourly Leq and Lmax in an office and publishes the data wirelessly at the Station X page on the website at the top of each hour. The criterion is set at 70 dBA. You can see the alarm history by clicking the “View Exceedance Events” button on the map page. By clicking the “Listen” button, you can listen to the exceedance events. Please turn the volume to maximum. The recording starts 1 minute before the exceedance event.
</ul>
